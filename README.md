# 🧾 CleanRideOS

**CleanRideOS** is a decentralized, lightweight operating system built for embedded devices to validate, reward, and coordinate regenerative physical infrastructure actions in the real world.

Powered by Web3 technologies, CleanRideOS transforms vehicles, mobility nodes, and infrastructure into decentralized validators of impact—starting with clean transportation. It integrates a stablecoin economy (Azos), privacy-preserving proofs (ZK), and open-source hardware support for use cases like clean ride validation, solar output metering, or marine credit tracking.

## 🌱 Mission

To build an operating system that enables anyone to:
- **Verify real-world regenerative actions** (like electric rides, solar production)
- **Distribute stable rewards** (via Azos tokens)
- **Connect to DePIN ecosystems** with cryptographic security and modularity

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

CleanRideOS is structured in 5 layers:

| Layer             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Kernel**        | Minimal Linux (Yocto/Alpine) with secure boot |
| **Node Client**   | Light blockchain client, IPFS, wallet |
| **Proof Engine**  | Validates real-world actions via GPS, sensors |
| **Runtime**       | Signs and submits reward claims to smart contracts |
| **UI/API**        | Interfaces for user dashboards, QR mobile linking, and APIs |

All components run locally on low-power embedded devices (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano), creating trust-minimized nodes in a global regenerative infrastructure.

## 🪙 Azos Stablecoin (Overview)

- **Purpose**: To reward regenerative activity (e.g., clean rides) without volatility
- **Backing**: $200M+ in green/blue bonds, RWA and real-world natural assets
- **Circulation**: Smart contract managed, on-chain audited
- **Usage**: Payouts, governance, DePIN staking, and local subsidies

## 🔐 Security Design

- Encrypted HD wallet storage
- Firmware and partition signing (tamper detection)
- Zero-knowledge module (ZK-SNARKs) for private trip validation
- IPFS/Arweave publishing of anonymized trip proofs

---

## 📦 Key Features

- ✅ Offline-verifiable proof generation
- ✅ Modular reward logic per deployment
- ✅ Web3-native: Ethereum L2, IPFS, and wallet-based auth
- ✅ Interoperable with DePIN & climate data marketplaces
